# Markov Models with Hash Table
This is a modeling system project using Markov Models to capture the statistical relationships present in speeches. The model is used in analyzing actual text and assessing the likelihood of a specific word uttered by the speaker.


The project involves a hash tables module, which creates data structures that store associations between keys and values. Hashtable Class includes the following methods:


* Set: A hashtable is set up with a specified length and key-value pairs

* Get: Values are extracted from the hash table using linear probing, if the keys exist.

* Rehashing: Using linear probing, the size of hash table is expanded and key-value pairs are migrated into their proper locations in the newly-expanded hash table 

* Deletion: Each key-value pair is marked with a binary value to indicate if the pair has been deleted from the hash table.
